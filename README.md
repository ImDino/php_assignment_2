# PHP assignment 2

* Create a RESTful API that generates 20 different products.

* It should resemble the following API:
> https://webacademy.se/fakestore

**Product example**
```javascript
{
"id": 1,
"title": "FjÃ¤llraven Backpack",
"description": "Your perfect pack for everyday use and walks in the forest. Stash your laptop (up to 15 inches) in the padded sleeve, your everyday",
"image": "https://picsum.photos/500?random=1",
"price": 109.95,
"category": "men clothing"
}
```

* The user should be able to get X amount of random items...
> https://webacademy.se/fakestore/v2/?show=5

* and also search for specific categories.
> https://webacademy.se/fakestore/v2/?category=jewelery

* Implement security optimizations.
> https://webacademy.se/fakestore/v2/?category=foo&show=100

**Demo**
```javascript
[
    {
        "Category": "Category not found"
    },
    {
        "Show": "Show must be between 1 and 20"
    }
]
```

* Publish your API on [Heroku](https://heroku.com/).
